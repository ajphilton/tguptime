   # tguptime-client

   Minimal static client scaffold for the tguptime project.

   How to run

   1. From the `tguptime-client` folder install any tooling (optional):

      ```bash
      cd /home/alexander_skystamper_com/projects/tguptime/tguptime-client
      # no install required; the start script uses npx to run a static server
      npm run start
      ```

   2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

   Notes

   - This is a minimal static scaffold. Add a build tool (Vite/Parcel/Create React App) or frameworks as needed.
   - To keep things light, the `start` script uses `npx http-server public -p 3000`.

   _This README was merged with the repository README when connecting the local `tguptime-client` workspace._
